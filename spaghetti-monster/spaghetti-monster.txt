Spaghetti Monster: A UI toolkit library for flashlights
-------------------------------------------------------

This toolkit takes care of most of the obnoxious parts of dealing with 
tiny embedded chips and flashlight hardware, leaving you to focus on the 
interface and user-visible features.

For a quick start, look at the example UIs provided to see how things 
are done.  They are probably the most useful reference.  However, other 
details can be found here or in the FSM source code.


Why is it called Spaghetti Monster?

  This toolkit is a finite state machine, or FSM.  Another thing FSM 
  stands for is Flying Spaghetti Monster.  Source code tends to weave 
  into intricate knots like spaghetti, called spaghetti code, 
  particularly when the code isn't using appropriate abstractions for 
  the task it implements.

  Prior e-switch light code had a tendency to get pretty spaghetti-like, 
  and it made the code difficult to write, understand, and modify.  So I 
  started from scratch and logically separated the hardware details from 
  the UI.  This effectively put the spaghetti monster in a box, put it 
  on a leash, to make it behave and stay out of the way while we focus 
  on the user interface.

  Also, it's just kind of a fun name.  :)


General concept:

  Spaghetti Monster (FSM) implements a stack-based finite state machine 
  with an event-handling system.

  Each FSM program should have a setup() function, a loop() function, 
  and at least one State:

    - The setup() function runs once each time power is connected.

    - The loop() function is called repeatedly whenever the system is 
      otherwise idle.  Put your long-running tasks here, preferably with 
      consideration taken to allow for cooperative multitasking.

    - The States on the stack will be called whenever an event happens.  
      States are called in top-to-bottom order until a state returns an 
      "EVENT_HANDLED" signal.  Only do quick tasks here.


Finite State Machine:

  Each "State" is simply a callback function which handles events.  It 
  should return EVENT_HANDLED for each event type it does something 
  with, or EVENT_NOT_HANDLED otherwise.

  Transitions between states typically involve mapping an Event to a new 
  State, such as this:

    // 3 clicks: go to strobe modes
    else if (event == EV_3clicks) {
        set_state(strobe_state, 0);
        return EVENT_HANDLED;
    }

  It is strongly recommended that your State functions never do anything 
  which takes more than a few milliseconds...  and certainly not longer 
  than 16ms.  If you do this, the pending events may pile up to the 
  point where new events get thrown away.  So, do only quick tasks in 
  the event handler, and do your longer-running tasks in the loop() 
  function instead.  Preferably with precautions taken to allow for 
  cooperative multitasking.

  Several state management functions are provided:

    - set_state(new_state, arg): Replace the current state on the stack.  
      Send 'arg' to the new state for its init event.

    - push_state(new_state, arg): Add a new state to the stack, leaving 
      the current state below it.  Send 'arg' to the new state for its 
      init event.

    - pop_state(): Get rid of (and return) the top-most state.  Re-enter 
      the state below.

Event types:

  Event types are defined in fsm-events.h.  You may want to adjust these 
  to fit your program, but the defaults are:

    State transitions:

      - EV_enter_state: Sent to each new State once when it goes onto 
        the stack.  The 'arg' is whatever you define it to be.

      - EV_leave_state: Sent to a state immediately before it is removed 
        from the stack.

    Time passing:

      - EV_tick: This happens once per clock tick, which is 16ms or 
        62.5Hz by default.  The 'arg' is the number of ticks since 
        entering the state.  When 'arg' exceeds 65535, it wraps around 
        to 32768.

    LVP and thermal regulation:

      - EV_voltage_low: Sent whenever the input power drops below the 
        VOLTAGE_LOW threshold.  Minimum of VOLTAGE_WARNING_SECONDS 
        between events.

      - EV_temperature_high: Sent whenever the MCU's projected temperature 
        is higher than therm_ceil.  Minimum of THERMAL_WARNING_SECONDS 
        between events.  The 'arg' indicates how far the temperature 
        exceeds the limit.

      - EV_temperature_low: Sent whenever the MCU's projected temperature 
        is lower than (therm_ceil - THERMAL_WINDOW_SIZE).  Minimum of 
        THERMAL_WARNING_SECONDS between events.  The 'arg' indicates how 
        far the temperature exceeds the limit.

    Button presses:

      - EV_1click: The user clicked the e-switch, released it, and 
        enough time passed that no more clicks were detected.

      - EV_2clicks: The user clicked and released the e-switch twice, then 
        enough time passed that no more clicks were detected.

      - EV_3clicks: The user clicked and released the e-switch three 
        times, then enough time passed that no more clicks were detected.

      - EV_4clicks: The user clicked and released the e-switch four times, 
        then enough time passed that no more clicks were detected.

      - EV_click1_hold: The user pressed the button and is still holding 
        it.  The 'arg' indicates how many clock ticks since the "hold" 
        state started.

      - EV_click1_hold_release: The user pressed the button, held it for a 
        while, and then released it.  No timeout is attempted after this.

      - EV_click2_hold: The user clicked once, then pressed the button and 
        is still holding it.  The 'arg' indicates how many clock ticks 
        since the "hold" state started.

      - EV_click2_hold_release: The user clicked once, then pressed the 
        button, held it for a while, and released it.  No timeout is 
        attempted after this.

      - EV_click1_press: The user pressed the button and it's still down.  
        No time has yet passed.

      - EV_click1_release: The user quickly pressed and released the 
        button.  The click timeout has not yet expired, so they might 
        still click again.

      - EV_click2_press: The user pressed the button, released it, pressed 
        again, and it's still down.  No time has yet passed since then.

      - EV_click2_release: The quickly pressed and released the button 
        twice.  The click timeout has not yet expired, so they might still 
        click again.

  In theory, you could also define your own arbitrary event types, and 
  emit() them as necessary, and handle them in State functions the same 
  as any other event.


Cooperative multitasking:

  Since we don't have true preemptive multitasking, the best we can do 
  is cooperative multitasking.  In practice, this means:

    - Declare global variables as volatile if they can be changed by an 
      event handler.  This keeps the compiler from caching the value and 
      causing incorrect behavior.

    - Don't put long-running tasks into State functions.  Each State 
      will get called at least once every 16ms for a clock tick, so they 
      should not run for longer than 16ms.

    - Put long-running tasks into loop() instead.

    - For long delay() calls, use nice_delay_ms().  This allows the MCU 
      to process events while we wait.  It also automatically aborts if 
      it detects a state change, and returns a different value.

      In many cases, it shouldn't be necessary to do anything more than 
      this, but sometimes it will also be a good idea to check the 
      return value and abort the current task:

          if (! nice_delay_ms(mydelay)) break;

    - In general, try to do small amounts of work and then return 
      control to other parts of the program.  Keep doing small amounts 
      and yielding until a task is done, instead of trying to do it all 
      at once.


Useful #defines:

  A variety of things can be #defined before including 
  spaghetti-monster.h in your program.  This allows you to tweak the 
  behavior and set options to fit your needs:

    - FSM_something_LAYOUT: Select a driver type from tk-attiny.h.  This 
      controls how many power channels there are, which pins they're on, 
      and what other driver features are available.

    - USE_LVP: Enable low-voltage protection.

      - VOLTAGE_LOW: What voltage should LVP trigger at?  Defaults to 29 (2.9V).

      - VOLTAGE_FUDGE_FACTOR: Add this much to the voltage measurements, 
        to compensate for voltage drop across the reverse-polarity 
        diode.

      - VOLTAGE_WARNING_SECONDS: How long to wait between LVP events.

    - USE_THERMAL_REGULATION: Enable thermal regulation

      - DEFAULT_THERM_CEIL: Set the temperature limit to use by default 
        when the user hasn't configured anything.

      - THERMAL_WARNING_SECONDS: How long to wait between temperature 
        events.

    - USE_RAMPING: Enable smooth ramping helpers.

      - RAMP_LENGTH: Pick a pre-defined ramp by length.  Defined sizes 
        are 50, 75, and 150 levels.

    - USE_DELAY_4MS, USE_DELAY_MS, USE_DELAY_ZERO: Enable the delay_4ms, 
      delay_ms(), and delay_zero() functions.  Useful for timing-related 
      activities.

    - HOLD_TIMEOUT: How many clock ticks before a "press" event becomes 
      a "hold" event?

    - RELEASE_TIMEOUT: How many clock ticks before a "release" event 
      becomes a "click" event?  Basically, the maximum time between 
      clicks in a double-click or triple-click.

    - ... and many others.  Will try to document them over time, but 
      they can be found by searching for pretty much anything in 
      all-caps in the fsm-*.[ch] files.
